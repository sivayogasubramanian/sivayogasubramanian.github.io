```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, there!")
}
```

Iâ€™m thrilled to introduce my newly revamped blog! After a brief hiatus, Iâ€™m excited to dive back into writing and share my insights on a wide range of topics. Stay tuned for fresh content!

My previous blog is still accessible [here](https://v1.blog.sivarn.com). While I wonâ€™t be migrating the old content, Iâ€™ve decided to keep it live as an archive for those interested.

Having recently graduated from college and begun my journey as a software engineer, this blog marks a fresh chapter in my life. I look forward to sharing my experiences and the knowledge I gain along the way.

Thanks for reading, and welcome to this new adventure! ðŸš€
